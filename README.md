# ReLeaf - Heat Island Mitigation Planner


## What is ReLeaf?

ReLeaf is a smart urban planning tool designed to help cities and communities combat the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. It analyzes environmental data to identify heat-prone areas and recommends nature-based solutions such as tree planting, green roofs, and shaded walkways.

By combining data analytics, climate science, and sustainability principles, ReLeaf empowers decision-makers to build cooler, healthier, and more resilient cities.

## Why ReLeaf?

Small steps create big futures, and we believe ReLeaf will create a lasting positive impact on urban environments.
With rising global temperatures and rapid urbanization, cities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to extreme heat. ReLeaf addresses this challenge by:

  - Reducing health risks caused by heat waves
  - Lowering energy consumption for cooling
  - Improving air quality
  - Promoting green infrastructure
  - Supporting climate-resilient development

ReLeaf helps transform climate data into actionable solutions
