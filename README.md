# EcoCode - Sustainability Software, Automated


## What is EcoCode?

EcoCode is a VS Code extension that:
  - Detects inefficient code pattersn
  - Flags unnecessary computation
  - Estimates CO₂ impact
  - Suggests greener alternatives

## Why EcoCode?
Most developers optimize for speed, cost, and reliability.
EcoCode adds sustainability.
Small steps create big futures, and we believe climate-aware software will power a world that lasts.


## Features

# Smart Code Analysis

EcoCode scans your code using static analysis to detect:
  - Heavy or nested loops
  - Redundant API calls
  - Large or uncompressed assets
  - Unnecessary repeated computations

# Carbom Impact Estimation

Using CO2.js and Green Web Foundation data, EcoCode displays
  - Carbon cost per run
  - Real-Equivalents to make impact understandable
  - TBF


# Green Refator Suggestions
In addition to warning developers, EcoCode recommends better optimizations, including:
  - More efficient algorithms
  - Better caching strategies
  - Asset optimization
